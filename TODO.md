## Now

### New Modules
- [X] better billing address parsing - v1.1
- [ ] fix "this Invalid account name / file not found (please click a tab to load the system)."?


### Features
- [ ] AutoRefresh - Calculate difference in table and update rather than fully reload autorefresh (phase 1 - only refresh if there IS a difference) - I believe this may be impossible
- [X] BillingAddressParser - click "use guest address" cause parser to run - v1.2

 
### Bugs
- [ ] BUG AutoRefresh not detecting actions & not logging after leaving page to activity then returning to availability - but refreshes still seem to happen..?
- [ ] BUG DoublePaymentPrevention - if enable paymentprevention with reservation & links already open, doesn't actually enable it yet	

 
### Code Review
- [ ] standardize "_" prefix and me. vs var for all; move attach/unattach to basemodule?
- [ ] AutoRefresh - review autoRefresh logic
- [ ] HookHelper
- [ ] EnhancementsController
- [ ] UsabilityEnhancements


## Later
