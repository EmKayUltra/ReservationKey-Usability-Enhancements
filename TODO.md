### New Modules


### Features
- [ ] HookHelper - change the way we hook into ajax events if possible instead of polling
- [ ] HookHelper - the way we sense page changes - potentially sense pages by hooking into "viewer" functions
- [ ] AutoRefresh - Calculate difference in table and update rather than fully reload autorefresh (phase 1 - only refresh if there IS a difference) - I believe this may be impossible
